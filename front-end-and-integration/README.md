**Ultimate Galaxy Search Documentation**
This blockchain gaming web app is built on the Base Sepolia Ethereum network from scratch using gamification concepts, solidity principles and front end technologies. With a combination of robust smart contracts and an intuitive design aiming for the best user interface and user experience, Ultimate Galaxy Search is the go-to area for blockchain play-to-earn, staking, dApp, ERC-20 and NFTs.

**About the Game**
If you are a super hero lover, then this blockchain based game is for you. The game features a collection of 22 superheros and villains. The logic is that at every level of the game, a collection of characters is being searched for in 60 seconds. Typically, between 3 to 5 characters as pre-determined by the game contract are being searched for. A player searches for these characters by clicking on them, and at the end of the duration, a smart contract call is executed to determine if the correct character has been chosen. Ultimate Galaxy Search ensures fairness by allowing the smart contract to determine the correct character randomly. After playing a level, your score is being shown to you via an event handler and if you pass, you are equally rewarded with Ultimate Galaxy Search Tokens (UGST) which are also shown in the event handler. A button has been created for players to claim their gaming rewards.
